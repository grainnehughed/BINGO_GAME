# BINGO_GAME
This is a script, written in Python, to generate a simple game of bingo, including the playing cards for players.

It uses the Pygame library (info for installation here: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) to display the randomly generated numbers.

The user is prompted to enter the number of players, then the programme generates a bingo playing card for each player. Then the user can proceed to generate random numbers until someone wins the game.
